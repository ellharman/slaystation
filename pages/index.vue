        SlayStation is the new London night celebrating gaming and the space it
        has provided queers to explore their identities. Now it's time to take
        that space IRL with performances, games, costumes, music, and prizes
        themed after your favourite series and moments.

      <p class="font-mono text-2xl text-justify w-auto">
        Since beginning at the end of 2021, we have had successful monthly shows
        covering different gaming genres and series, ranging from Sci-Fi to
        Fantasy, Fighting to Pok√©mon. We are committed to providing a safe space
        for all people to express themselves and have fun and we do this with an
        experience like no other in the world.

        So if you want to see a Solid Snake strip tease, glitchy Elder Scrolls
        parodies, or sexy Waluigi, this is the night for you!

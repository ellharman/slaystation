          SlayStation is the new London night celebrating gaming and the space
          it has provided queers to explore their identities. Now it's time to
          take that space IRL with performances, games, costumes, music, and
          prizes themed after your favourite series and moments.

          Since beginning at the end of 2021, we have had successful monthly
          shows covering different gaming genres and series, ranging from Sci-Fi
          to Fantasy, Fighting to Pok√©mon. We are committed to providing a safe
          space for all people to express themselves and have fun and we do this
          with an experience like no other in the world.
